Hello! Interestingly, I got introduced to web  development in my sophormore year at [Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, China](https://en.nuist.edu.cn//) where I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Technology (2016-2020) with [81.0% aggregate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iIGb6FHVH4BAzF_TbvSXvJjVpV6wT6Tb/view?usp=sharing).
